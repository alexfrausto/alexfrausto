## 🧑‍💻 About Me

- 🛠️ Crafting code and building things that (hopefully) are still relevant by the time you read this.
- 🌟 Full-stack wizardry, system architecture, and making things better (or, occasionally... breaking them for science).
- 🤓 Firm believer that code should be clean, efficient, and delightful to maintain (that’s what she said).
- 🧩 I love unraveling tricky problems and turning them into elegant solutions, though like any true dev, I might accidentally overcomplicate things just for the thrill of a good refactor.

## 🏆 Language & Tool Badges: Gotta Catch 'Em All!

Just like a Pokémon trainer, I'm on a quest to collect (and master) as many language and tool badges as I can:

## 🔥 Fun Facts

- 🧩 Give me a tough problem and I’ll happily spend hours unraveling it, then refactor it twice just for fun (and maybe add a layer or two of “necessary” abstraction).
- 🎵 My code commits are powered by playlists ranging from post-black grindcorewave to existential kawaii mathjazz, sprinkled with a touch of chiptune shoegaze and medieval synthpop.
- 👩‍💼 My wife is my project manager. She keeps my scope (and ego) in check.
- 🐶 My dogs are my code reviewers. Their feedback is mostly barks and tail wags, but the code is always paw-some.
